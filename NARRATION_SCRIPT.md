## HOOK (30 seconds)

We all have a love-hate relationship with AI...

Whether it's cranking out that essay due in one minute, or generating a lesson plan in seconds.

But have you ever stopped to think about how AI is quietly revolutionizing the chemical industry?

From designing life-saving drugs to predicting how molecules behave—AI is changing chemistry in ways we never imagined.

And that's exactly what we're going to explore today. I'm Mehar, and welcome to my presentation on Advances in Chemistry with AI.

## SECTION 1: What is AI? (1 minute)

Let's start with a simple question: What actually IS Artificial Intelligence?

AI refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence—learning from experience, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and even understanding language.

In chemistry, AI isn't just a buzzword. It's a practical toolkit that helps scientists predict molecular properties, design new drugs, plan synthesis routes, and analyze massive reaction datasets.

## SECTION 2: Types of AI Models (1.5 minutes)

So what types of AI models are chemists actually using today? Let me break it down.

*[VISUAL: Graph will appear when you say "evolved over time" or "model performance"]*

Here's a visualization showing how AI **model performance** has **evolved over time**.

There are several key model types: Neural Networks for property prediction, Graph Neural Networks that understand molecular structures, and Transformers that treat molecules like a language.

*[VISUAL: Network will appear when you say "neural network architecture"]*

Here's what a **neural network architecture** looks like—the building block of modern chemical AI.

Unlike traditional computers that follow explicit rules, these AI models LEARN from data. Train a neural network on millions of molecules, and it can predict properties of compounds it's never seen before.

## SECTION 3: Evolution of AI in Chemistry (1.5 minutes)

Now let's trace how AI in chemistry has evolved. This didn't happen overnight.

In the 1980s and 90s, we had rule-based expert systems—basically, chemists wrote down rules and computers followed them. Simple, but inflexible.

By the 2000s, statistical machine learning emerged. Models learned patterns from data, but still needed humans to design features.

The real revolution came after 2012 with deep learning. Neural networks started learning features automatically. This is when AlphaFold began changing protein science.

Today, in 2024, we have Foundation Models and Large Language Models like ChemDFM that can reason about chemistry in natural language. It's a completely different paradigm.

## SECTION 4: System Prompts (1 minute)

Speaking of language models, let me explain something crucial: system prompts.

A system prompt is the initial set of instructions given to an AI before it interacts with users. Think of it as "personality programming" that shapes how the AI responds.

For a chemical LLM, the system prompt might say: "Always conserve mass. Follow valency rules. Carbon forms 4 bonds. Prioritize non-toxic reagents. Cite your confidence level."

According to arXiv paper 2505.07027, system prompts are CRITICAL for ensuring chemical validity. Without them, an AI might suggest reactions that violate fundamental chemistry laws—like creating atoms out of nothing!

---

## SECTION 5: LLM-Augmented Synthesis (1 minute)

With the right prompts, AI models can do something remarkable: they can plan entire synthesis routes automatically.

Traditional synthesis planning requires a chemist to mentally work backwards from a target molecule, checking precursor availability at each step. This takes hours or even days.

LLM-augmented systems like "LLM-Syn-Planner" from arXiv 2505.07027 use evolutionary search combined with LLM reasoning to generate and optimize complete **retrosynthetic pathways** in minutes.

*[VISUAL: Reaction will appear when you say "reaction pathway" or "retrosynthetic"]*

Here's a visualization of how AI plans a **reaction pathway**.

## SECTION 6: ChemDFM (1.5 minutes)

Now let's talk about a specific breakthrough: ChemDFM, the Chemical Dialogue Foundation Model.

According to arXiv paper 2401.14818, ChemDFM was trained on 34 BILLION tokens from over 3.8 million chemistry papers and 1,400 textbooks. It was then fine-tuned with 2.7 million chemical instructions.

*[VISUAL: 3D Molecule will appear when you say "molecular structure"]*

Let's visualize a **molecular structure** that ChemDFM can analyze in real-time.

What makes ChemDFM special? Unlike GPT-4 which treats chemistry as regular text, ChemDFM UNDERSTANDS SMILES notation—the way chemists write molecules as text strings. It speaks chemistry natively.

And here's the kicker: despite being only 13 billion parameters, ChemDFM OUTPERFORMS GPT-4 on chemical benchmarks. Size isn't everything—specialization matters.

---

## SECTION 7: ChemDFM vs AlphaFold (1 minute)

How does ChemDFM compare to AlphaFold? They're actually complementary, not competitors.

AlphaFold predicts WHAT a protein looks like—folding amino acid sequences into 3D structures. It revolutionized structural biology.

*[VISUAL: Protein will appear when you say "protein structure"]*

Here's a **protein structure** visualization—the kind of output AlphaFold produces.

ChemDFM, on the other hand, focuses on chemical synthesis and reasoning. It helps design molecules that INTERACT with proteins. One predicts structure, the other designs function.

The arXiv paper 2502.11326 on IDPForge actually addresses AlphaFold's limitations: it struggles with "disordered proteins" that don't have fixed structures. The field keeps pushing forward.

---

## SECTION 8: Retrosynthesis (1 minute)

Finally, let's talk about retrosynthesis—one of the most exciting AI applications in chemistry.

Retrosynthesis is the art of working BACKWARDS. You start with a complex target molecule and break it down step-by-step into simpler, commercially available starting materials.

The breakthrough from arXiv 2510.16590 is "Atom-Anchored LLMs". These models assign UNIQUE identifiers to every atom in a molecule and track them through the reaction.

This atom-level reasoning achieves over 90% accuracy in identifying where reactions should happen, and 74% accuracy in predicting the final reactants. No atoms are lost or magically created.

---

## INTERACTIVE DEMO (30 seconds)

*[VISUAL: Kinetics simulation will appear when you say "collision theory" or "reaction rates"]*

Let me show you something interactive. This simulation demonstrates **Collision Theory**—how temperature and concentration affect **reaction rates**.

---

## CONCLUSION (30 seconds)

So to summarize what we've covered today...

AI in chemistry has evolved from simple rule-based systems to powerful foundation models like ChemDFM. System prompts ensure chemical validity. LLM-augmented programs automate synthesis planning. And atom-anchored reasoning brings unprecedented precision to retrosynthesis.

From generating essays to revolutionizing drug discovery, AI is proving that its potential stretches far beyond what we initially imagined. In chemistry, it's not replacing scientists—it's giving them superpowers.

Thank you for joining my exploration of AI in Chemistry! This has been Mehar Khanna.
